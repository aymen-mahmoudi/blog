    <h1>Sensors</h1>
</div>

<p>The sensor is the core of the camera, serving as the light-sensitive component that captures light and converts it
    into electrical signals to create an image. On this page, I focus exclusively on sensors in mirrorless cameras. The
    primary characteristics of a sensor are its size and pixel count.</p>

<h3>Sensor's size</h3>
<p>Sensors come in different sizes, ranging from tiny sensors in smartphones to large sensors in professional cameras.
    The sensor size in a camera refers to the physical dimensions of the light-sensitive area inside the camera where
    the image is captured. It is one of the most important factors in determining the quality, depth of field, and
    overall characteristics of your photos. The image below cover the common sizes, including the full-frame, the APS-C,
    Micro Four Thirds (MFT) and 1 inch types.
</p>

To go deeper, a notion of crop factor must be undertood, the crop factor refers to the multiplier applied to a lens's
focal length to account for the difference in sensor size compared to a full-frame (35mm) sensor as a refrence. Smaller
sensors, like APS-C or Micro Four Thirds, <b>crop the image and narrow the field of view</b>. For example, an APS-C
sensor with a crop factor of 1.6x (in Canon cameras) makes a 50mm lens behave like an 80mm lens in terms of field of
view (50mm Ã— 1.6). This is noramally a disatages since it narrow the field of view but it can be beneficial particularly
for telephoto photography, as it provides extra reach without requiring a longer lens.
<br>
Understanding crop factor is crucial for selecting lenses and framing shots, as it influences composition and the
effective coverage of the scene. The image below show a complete overview of the sensors types and their crop factors
values.

<ul>

    <li>
        <p>Medium Format Sensors:
            <br>
            Medium Format Sensor is the only sensor bigger than the reference sensor with a crop factor of 0.65. Camras
            with these type of sensor are very expensive and oriented for highly professional uses and cinematic videos.
            These sensors offers superior low-light performances, higher dynamic range, and shallower depth of field.
        </p>
    </li>


    <li>
        <p>Full-Frame Sensors:
            <br>
            The full-frame size is the reference size of sensros and it is equivalent in size to a 35mm film frame (36mm
            x 24mm). This sensors is the standard for high-quality photography allowing good low-light performance. The
            image below explain visually the difference of sizes of the different sensors.

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>APS-C Sensors:
            <br>
            The APS-C sensor is smaller than a full-frame sensor, typically measuring around 22mm x 15mm, with a crop factor of 1.5x (or 1.6x for Canon). APS-C cameras popular for wildlife and sports photography. While smaller than full-frame, APS-C sensors still deliver excellent image quality, are more affordable, and allow for lighter, more compact camera bodies and lenses. They offer a versatile balance of performance, portability, and cost, making them ideal for hobbyists and professionals seeking a practical all-rounder.

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>1-Inch type Sensors:
            <br>
            1-inch sensor measures around 13.2mm x 8.8mm. Despite its compact size, it offers significantly better image quality and low-light performance compared to smartphone sensors. Cameras with 1-inch sensors strike a balance between portability and performance, making them ideal for high-end compact cameras and travel photography. The smaller size allows for lightweight designs, while still enabling features like manual controls and decent background blur (bokeh) with the right lenses. This sensor type is popular among enthusiasts and vloggers looking for a compact yet capable camera.
            <br>

            Any sensor that is about 1.5 to 1-inch in size or smaller can be found in non-interchangeable lens cameras
            (your typical point and shoot) and smartphone cameras. The sensors in smartphone are smaller than 1 inch even for the flagships. The image below compare the
            sensors sizes of the flagships over the years, we see than it is getting bigger but never going up to 1 inch which is comprehnesive since the size and the cost of the smartphone itself. Smartphone photography rely more on the numerical processing to enhace the image quality.

<h3>pixel count</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the course, we didn't have many good active learning worksheets, and we didn't have any solid
    resources with consistent notation. So I started writing these notes as a de facto resource.</p>
